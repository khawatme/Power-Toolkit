#Privacy Policy for Power-Toolkit
**Last Updated**: September 19, 2025

Power-Toolkit is designed with privacy as a core principle. 
The extension does not collect, store, share, 
or transmit any personal information, browsing activity, or user data. 
All operations run locally in your browser.

The extension interacts only with Microsoft Power Apps and Dynamics 365 by making API calls to your authenticated Dataverse environment.
These calls use your existing Microsoft login. 
Retrieved data is shown only inside the extension and is never stored or sent to third parties.

Permissions required:

- ActiveTab and scripting are used solely to inject code into the active Dynamics 365 or Power Apps tab when you click the extension icon.
  
- The extension does not access or interact with other sites or tabs.

We may update this Privacy Policy in future releases. 
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on the Toolkit-GitHub repository.
