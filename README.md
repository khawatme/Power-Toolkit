## âœ¨ Key Features

The toolkit is organized into a clear, tab-based interface, with each tab providing a distinct and powerful capability:

* **Live Form Inspection & Editing:**
    * **Inspector:** A real-time tree view of the form's UI hierarchy.
    * **Form Columns:** An interactive grid of all form attributes with live editing.
    * **Event Monitor:** A live console that logs `OnLoad`, `OnSave`, and `OnChange` events as they happen.

* **Automation & Logic Debugging:**
    * **Form Automation:** View, manage, activate, and deactivate Business Rules for any table. Inspect the underlying JavaScript logic of any rule. Also lists static `OnLoad`/`OnSave` event handlers.
    * **Plugin Context:** Simulate the `Target`, `PreEntityImage`, and `PostEntityImage` sent to server-side plugins. Includes a C# unit test generator for FakeXrmEasy.
    * **Plugin Traces:** A real-time viewer for server-side Plugin Trace Logs with live polling and powerful filtering.

* **Data & API Interaction:**
    * **WebAPI Explorer:** A full client to execute GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests against the Dataverse Web API.
    * **FetchXML Tester:** A powerful builder and editor to write, format, and execute FetchXML queries.
    * **Metadata Browser:** A complete, searchable dictionary of all tables and columns in the environment.

* **Security & Configuration:**
    * **Impersonate:** Test security roles by executing all tool operations as another user.
    * **User Context:** View a detailed breakdown of the current (or impersonated) user's security roles, including those inherited from teams.
    * **Environment Variables:** View and edit all Environment Variables and their current values.

* **And More...** including a Performance analyzer, a library of modern JavaScript code snippets, and fully customizable settings.
